# NOTE: to run this you MUST set the REPOSITORY environment variable to
# your own image registry/namespace otherwise the `docker push` commands
# will fail due to an auth failure. Which means, you also need to be logged
# into that registry before you run it.

docker build -t ${REPOSITORY}/sbdocker .
